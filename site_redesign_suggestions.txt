Resolved suggestions:
Don't like the two main buttons under the page title. Resolved with new header bar.
Shouldn't have to go out and back in to find courses in other departments. Resolved with new header bar.
New color scheme(s). Rejected in favor of keeping the maroon-and-light-gray scheme.
Search by: # of credits, department, professor, keyword. Resolved with plan for universal search.
Make it clear which courses are comm intensive and which are not. Resolved with plan to mark courses communication-intensive.
Save schedule to file functionality. Resolved by creating a wishlist issue for it.
Split screen with schedule and course list in the same window at once (also for schedule page only). Rejected as too visually complex.
Selected courses display in some other way than checkboxes. Resolved by changing the background color of selected courses.
Allow conflicting classes; YACS does not let people make such schedules now, but the registrar does. Resolved by making a wishlist issue for it.
No two columns in department list. Resolved by having columns, but grouping all departments by school instead of alphabetically.


Unresolved suggestions:
Courses load latency
No course list in schedule view (that part is resolved) - display course details some other way
Replace the semester selector in top left with some other way to select
Clearer/more intuitive directions for picking "busy" times on the schedule
Mobile friendliness - no tiny text and zoom for everything
