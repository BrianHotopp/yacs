Yet Another Course Scheduler

iOS repository https://github.com/JGrippo/YACSiOS

Simple, Sane Course Scheduling.
YACS is a web-based course scheduler with an emphasis on usability.
If you're an RPI student and looking to use it, go to [our temporary Heroku site](http://yacs.herokuapp.com). Fall 2015 courses aren't available yet, though. The old YACS site can be found at [yacs.me](http://yacs.me).
(Note that this link still points to the old YACS page and not the one we're making.)

Visit [our blog](https://yacsblog.wordpress.com/) for more updates and information.
